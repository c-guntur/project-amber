= ‚ö†Ô∏è Java Compiler Intrinsics for JDK APIs

^&nbsp;On&nbsp;hold:&nbsp;https://openjdk.java.net/jeps/348[JEP-348]^

* Enable *Java compilers* to use novel code generation strategies. to improve performance of certain Java SE methods.

* Enable *JDK developers* to tag methods as candidates & implement alternate translations of invocations.

To intrinsify a specific invocation of a given method, all of the following have to happen:

. The *method opts in* to intrinsification at its declaration site, as part of its specification;
. The compiler *identifies* this invocation *as intrinsifiable*;
. The compiler *knows of an intrinsic processor* for the method;
. The intrinsic processor indicates an *alternate translation strategy*; and
. The compiler *generates the bytecode* corresponding to the *indicated strategy*.

    Intensification (sic: Intrinsification) is a big, big hammer;
    it should be reserved for when it yields big, big results.
